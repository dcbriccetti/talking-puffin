The primary purpose of this project was for its author to learn, and play around
with, Scala, the scala.swing package, and the Twitter API, and to educate others 
in the same. But now the product, a simple Twitter client, has become useful.

To do:

Persist configuration data
When starting, resume where user left off
More filtering
  Followers/Non-followers (@vdichev)
Change code to the Scala way of doing things
  Use Scala's immutable List instead of Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList[Node]())  (@vdichev)
Allow overriding default URLs for requests, to allow use with non-Twitter systems (@vdichev)
